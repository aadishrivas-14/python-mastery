# Day 5: Design Patterns

Master common design patterns through 15 exercises.

## Topics Covered
- Creational Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype)
- Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy)
- Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Iterator, Template, Chain of Responsibility)

## Structure
- `src/patterns.py` - TODO stubs for 15 design patterns
- `tests/test_patterns.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Run Tests
```bash
cd day5-design-patterns
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Patterns
1. Singleton - Single instance
2. Factory - Object creation
3. Builder - Step-by-step construction
4. Prototype - Clone objects
5. Adapter - Interface conversion
6. Decorator - Add functionality
7. Facade - Simplified interface
8. Proxy - Control access
9. Observer - Event notification
10. Strategy - Algorithm selection
11. Command - Encapsulate requests
12. State - State-based behavior
13. Iterator - Sequential access
14. Template Method - Algorithm skeleton
15. Chain of Responsibility - Request handling chain
